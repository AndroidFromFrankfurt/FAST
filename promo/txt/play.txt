    <string name="long">Find and Launch Applications fast and for free with a small App that needs not a single permission!
Just type in a fraction of the name of the App you want to launch - most of the time 3 chars are enough.

A single click launches the App - a long click gives you 3 Options:
 #1 Go to the App details
 #2 Open the App in Google Play
 #3 Open the App as a Notification for FAST access at a later time

The App is GPLv3 - you can find the source on GitHub: https://github.com/ligi/FAST
